            Hello everyone viewing my page, my name is
            <strong>Noah Chang</strong> and I am first year computer science
            major. Aside from my student life, I am a classical musician,
            playing both the piano and alto saxophone. I also love to write
            classical music!
          </p>
          <p>
            My goals are to work hard this year and learn valuable life skills
            like leading, problem solving and self-learning.
