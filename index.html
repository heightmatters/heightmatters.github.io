        Hello everyone viewing my page, my name is
        <strong>Noah Chang</strong> and I am first year computer science major.
        Aside from my student life, I am a classical musician, playing both the
        piano and alto saxophone. I also love to write classical music!
      </p>
      <p>
        My goals are to work hard this year and learn valuable life skills like
        leading, problem solving and self-learning.
